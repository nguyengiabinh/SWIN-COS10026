                                        <p>In this book, Harry Potter learns a
                                            lot about Lord Voldemort's past, and
                                            Harry Potter prepares for the final
                                            battle against his nemesis with the
                                            help of Headmaster Dumbledore. But
                                            in that time, Voldemort returns to
                                            power, and makes a plan to destroy
                                            Harry. So, Harry Potter tries to
                                            destroy Voldemort first, but for
                                            that, Harry must collect all parts
                                            of his soul. Voldemort had split his
                                            soul into pieces, so that he would
                                            never be totally destroyed, and now
                                            Harry has to destroy all the pieces,
                                            so Harry sets out with Dumbledore to
                                            find the Horcruxes.</p>
                                        <p>At a memorable moment, near the
                                            beginning, Hermione gets very angry
                                            at Harry because he starts doing
                                            very good in the potions class.
                                            Harry starts doing so well after he
                                            finds the “Advanced Potion-Making”
                                            book that was filled with quicker
                                            ways to make potions. It was
                                            personally improved by Professor
                                            Snape, and then nicknamed the “Half
                                            Blood Prince”.</p>
                                        <p>This novel can definitely petrify you
                                            as well, like in one part, Harry and
                                            Dumbledore go out to find the 1st
                                            Horcrux, where Dumbledore is forced
                                            to drink the Drink of Despair, which
                                            is a mysterious potion that makes a
                                            wizard very vulnerable and weak. So,
                                            this potion is meant for protecting
                                            something very important.</p>

                                        <p>In this book, Harry Potter learns a
                                            lot about Lord Voldemort's past, and
                                            Harry Potter prepares for the final
                                            battle against his nemesis with the
                                            help of Headmaster Dumbledore. But
                                            in that time, Voldemort returns to
                                            power, and makes a plan to destroy
                                            Harry. So, Harry Potter tries to
                                            destroy Voldemort first, but for
                                            that, Harry must collect all parts
                                            of his soul. Voldemort had split his
                                            soul into pieces, so that he would
                                            never be totally destroyed, and now
                                            Harry has to destroy all the pieces,
                                            so Harry sets out with Dumbledore to
                                            find the Horcruxes.</p>
                                        <p>At a memorable moment, near the
                                            beginning, Hermione gets very angry
                                            at Harry because he starts doing
                                            very good in the potions class.
                                            Harry starts doing so well after he
                                            finds the “Advanced Potion-Making”
                                            book that was filled with quicker
                                            ways to make potions. It was
                                            personally improved by Professor
                                            Snape, and then nicknamed the “Half
                                            Blood Prince”.</p>
                                        <p>This novel can definitely petrify you
                                            as well, like in one part, Harry and
                                            Dumbledore go out to find the 1st
                                            Horcrux, where Dumbledore is forced
                                            to drink the Drink of Despair, which
                                            is a mysterious potion that makes a
                                            wizard very vulnerable and weak. So,
                                            this potion is meant for protecting
                                            something very important.</p>

                                            lot about Lord Voldemort's past, and
                                            Harry Potter prepares for the final
                                            battle against his nemesis with the
                                            help of Headmaster Dumbledore. But
                                            in that time, Voldemort returns to
                                            power, and makes a plan to destroy
                                            Harry. So, Harry Potter tries to
                                            destroy Voldemort first, but for
                                            that, Harry must collect all parts
                                            of his soul. Voldemort had split his
                                            soul into pieces, so that he would
                                            never be totally destroyed, and now
                                            Harry has to destroy all the pieces,
                                            so Harry sets out with Dumbledore to
                                            find the Horcruxes.</p>
                                        <p>At a memorable moment, near the
                                            beginning, Hermione gets very angry
                                            at Harry because he starts doing
                                            very good in the potions class.
                                            Harry starts doing so well after he
                                            finds the “Advanced Potion-Making”
                                            book that was filled with quicker
                                            ways to make potions. It was
                                            personally improved by Professor

                                            Blood Prince”.</p>
                                        <p>This novel can definitely petrify you
                                            as well, like in one part, Harry and
                                            Dumbledore go out to find the 1st
                                            Horcrux, where Dumbledore is forced
                                            to drink the Drink of Despair, which
                                            is a mysterious potion that makes a
